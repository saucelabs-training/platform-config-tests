# Platform Configurator Tests

This project is a test suite to validate code generated by the 
[Sauce Labs Platform Configurator](https://saucelabs.com/platform/platform-configurator#/).
The tests are based on manual copy/pasting of current or future generated code.

This project is not intended for public use or contributions, but since it may be instructive for executing basic tests on 
Sauce Labs based on Platform Configurator code, it is made available with an open source license.
